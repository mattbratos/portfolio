 web based mp3 player



I'm making my own mp3 player. I'm using the following technologies:
HTML CSS JavaScript
The uniqe thing about it is that users will be able switch between different version on the same song. For example Hi-Fi, Lo-Fi, Vinyl, Tape. 
Write me HTML CSS JavaScript code for this website.
